<h1 class="centered">Being Successful by being Assessed</h1>



Here is a path and a set of activities to success in this course.
<ol>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(Daily)</span> Personally study one or more technologies on your own time separate from your team.</li>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(At Least Once a Week)</span> Meet with your team to discuss what you and they have learned.</li>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(As Often as Needed)</span> Interact with your instructor verify your understandings, get answers to knowledgeable, well-framed questions, and to get professional design and development opinions.</li>
	<li><span class="bookTitle">(Every Other Week)</span> Provide the documentation to your instructor required for a professionalism assessment and recording of your fluency as described below and in the course rubric.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Through your continual interactions with your instructor, and by observing your on-going interactions with your team and classmates, your instructor develops a deep understanding of your fluency and professionalism. They come to know you and how to help you improve your professionalism and increase your technical fluency. This understanding is much deeper than any feedback or evidence a test or quiz could provide. Regardless of if you are in an online or face-to-face class, the assessment is the same but the process differs.
</p>
<h3>For Online Students</h3>
<p>
In order to help you improve your fluency and professionalism, you should try to upload documentation of your fluency to your instructor at least weekly. These ungraded fluency assessments are your opportunity to get help and let your instructor see your increasing fluency in one or more technical topics. When you submit documentation for these assessments, your instructor gives you direct and timely feedback to help you learn and grow. You're fluency is not recorded at this time. Successful students usually need to upload this documentation multiple times before the instructor indicates they are ready to request a recording of their fluency. <span class="bookTitle">You</span> must have created this documentation, not your team, a tutor, a previous student, the internet, or any other person or source.
</p>
<p> After having assessed your fluency in a technical topic at least once, your instructor will let you know when you are allowed to request a recording of your fluency for that topic. You can only request your fluency be recorded every other week (semi-weekly). This means there is insufficient time for you to submit one or two technology fluency requests every other week. Plan ahead.
</p>
<p>You must submit a document listing each of the topics for which you want your fluency recorded as part of your semi-weekly professionalism assessments. This fluency document must be written as if it was a letter and you must state you have completed the changes required by your teacher for each individual fluency you want recorded. Last of all, sign the letter digitally.
</p>
<p>
Along with or as part of this letter, you have an oportunity to have your professionalism assessed. To do this, you must upload the professionalism documentation described in the class rubric. Do not request a professionalism assessment unless you have technology fluencies to record. It is your responsibility to prove your fluency and professionalism. It is not the instructor's responsibility to 'pull it out of you.' Be the honest person you are. It will hurt you in life, your career, and the class if you choose to deceive.

<h3>For Face-to-Face Students</h3>
In order to help you improve your fluency and professionalism, you should try to meet with your instructor about every other week in their office. These semiweekly fluency and professionalism assessments are your opportunity to provide the direct evidence described in the rubric in order to achieve your goal. <span class="bookTitle">You</span> must have created this evidence, not your team, a tutor, a previous student, the internet, or any other person or source. You will sign up for a <strong>10 minute</strong> meeting in which you will declare the one or more topics for which you have previously been assessed on in class. Then your professionalism will be assessed based on the instructor's observations of and interactions with you. <em><strong>This is not a slide presentation.</strong></em> In class, your instructor will determine if you know and understand how to use the topic, what options the topic gives you when coding and designing, you are using and understanding the topic correctly, and you can fully explain the topic fluently and well. After being assessed, you can, if you desire, spend additional time further developing fluency and then provide more evidence on that topic in class. This recursive process is used for assessing both the coding and the diagram fluency.
