<h1 class="centered">The Ophelia Syndrome</h1>
<p>Read <a href="https://ucs.byu.edu/sites/default/files/readings/OpheliaSyndrome-Plummer.pdf">Diagnosing and Treating the Ophelia Syndrome</a>. Please time yourself and keep track of how long, in minutes, it takes for you to read this article. Please don't guess and don't hurry. This isn't a race. Read to understand instead of hurrying.</p>
<p>After completing the reading survey, read <a href="http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2013_10_08_Kerr.htm">The Divine Law of Learning</a>.</p>
<p>These two articles reinforce each other. Ponder deeply about in what ways you may currently be Ophelia. Also, ponder deeply how you might need to change in order to meet what Elder Kerr states is The Lord's desire for your education.</p>
<p>Write your conclusions and any of your plans for change in your personal journal. Be honest and specific. The instructor will never see and will never ask for what you write.</p>
